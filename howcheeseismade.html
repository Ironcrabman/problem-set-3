         <li>Milk
         <li>Rennet
         <li>Calcium Chloride

    <h3>Process</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Milk is extracted from the cow via milking
        <li>The milk is then pasturized to remove bacteria
        <li>The pasturized milk is put into a cheese vat
        <li>The cheese vat is set to an optimal temerature for bacteria culture to grow
        <li>Rennet, an enzyme, is added turning the milk into a gel like substance
        <li>After the curd has fermented, it is cut into pieces and heated
            <ol>
                <li>Heating the curd allows it to seperate from the whey
            </ol>
        <li>The whey is then drained out of the cheese vat and only curd is left
        <li>Curd strips are then layered and flipped to continue the fermentation process
            <ol><li>This process is known as cheddaring
            </ol>
        <li>At this point the process differs depending on what cheese is being made
            <ol>
                <li>Cheeses like Mozarella get shaped into loaves and placed into a salt water solution
                <li>Cheeses like cheddar are made by mixing the curds with salt
            </ol>
        <li>All cheeses are then shaped and aged for varying amounts of time
          </ol>
